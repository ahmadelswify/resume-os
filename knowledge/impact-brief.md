# Impact Brief — Metrics & Achievements Library

<!--
This is your "bullet bank" — a comprehensive library of quantified achievements
that the resume agent draws from when tailoring your resume.

For each achievement, include:
- The metric or outcome (quantified)
- Context (what you were working on)
- Your specific contribution
- Tags for easy matching (role type, skill area)

The more detailed and numerous your entries, the better the agent can match
your experience to any job description.
-->

## How to Use This File

Write achievements in a format like:

```
### [Short title]
- **Metric:** Reduced deployment time by 40% (from 2 hours to 45 minutes)
- **Context:** CI/CD pipeline migration for 15-person engineering team
- **My role:** Led the initiative, selected tooling, wrote migration scripts
- **Tags:** DevOps, automation, leadership, CI/CD
```

The agent will scan these entries and select the ones that best match
each job description's requirements.
